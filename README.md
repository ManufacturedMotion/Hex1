Hex is a six legged OpenSource Hexapod designed to serve as a moving platform for you to tinker with and build on top of! We are currently working on the third generation of the platform, Hex3.

This repo contains all the latest resources of our first iteration, Hex1. This build was our first attempt, and we have made many improvements since then. If you are attempting to build your own, we suggest you checkout our latest resources. At the time of writing, [we are working on Hex3](https://github.com/ManufacturedMotion/Hex3)!
